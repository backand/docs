#Anonymous Access
If you wish to enable anonymous access to your application, you need to perform a couple steps. First, you need to turn on the Anonymous Access option in you application's settings. Once that's done, you are given the option to create an AnonymousToken value. By passing this value in a request header (e.g. AnonymousToken=<your token here>) you can perform api actions for your application. finally, you need to set the default role of an anonymous user within your application's settings (see [roles](../security/roles.md) for more info).
