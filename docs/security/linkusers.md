#Link your app's users with Backand's users
We offer full capability to link your application's users with Backand users. However, to ensure that you can restrict access to your application without impacting the Backand user's experiece, we recommend that you create another table for your app's users with a unique email address column. This allows you to build rules specific to your app, but still link to Backand's users without affecting their overall experience.
