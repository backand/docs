#Roles & Security Templates
Each user has a role. When you created your app, you were automatically assigned with an "Admin" role. The "Admin" role is a special role that allows you to make configuration changes in your app with Backand's administration tools. Non-admin roles, which should be used to secure your application, are used to define the permissions for each of the [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) actions for your objects and queries. Each Object and Query in your application is associated with a Security Template. In the security template, you assign different permissions for the possible [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) actions to each user role, allowing you to control your user's access to the system's create, read, update and delete actions for your objects. Template configuration is found on the Security & Auth --> Security Template page.

While Security Templates provide reusable permissions platforms that can be spread across a number of roles, you can also override security template settings and provide specific permissions for each individual role. This allows you to have more granular control over the [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) actions that can be performed by the users in your system. When a user with insufficient security access tries to perform an action for which they do not have permission, a 403 (Forbidden) error response is returned.
