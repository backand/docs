Facebook recently opened up their Messenger platform to enable bots to converse with users through Facebook Apps and on Facebook Pages. In support of this, the Facebook Messenger team created a comprehensive set of [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) describing the functionality on offer.
While they offer a lot of functionality and platform-level integration for free, you still need to create a publicly-accessible application that Facebook can communicate with in order to communicate with your end users. 

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating your own messenger bot with a back-end ready to go, powered by Backand and live - all in 10 minutes.
