In Backand's system, you can create server-side activity called Actions. These actions can be used for the purpose of security, integration, performance, notification and data integrity, among others, providing you with more flexibility in your app's design. There are two types of Actions that can be created. The first are initiated via a direct web request. These are known as "On Demand" actions. Additionally, you can create automated actions that take place based upon a data interaction event. These automated actions can occur whenever you create, update, or delete an item in your system. On Demand actions are associated with a specific object, and can be found on the Object --> {name} page in the Actions tab. The automated Create, Update and Delete actions are associated with a specific object that is compatible with a specific row in a table, while On Demand actions make association with a specific role optional.

There are 3 kinds of actions that can be created for either action type:
- Server side JavaScript code actions
- Transactional database script actions
- Send Email actions
All 3 types of actions use the following common parameters:
* A Where condition - a SQL where clause that determines if the action will be performed.
* Input Parameters, added to the query string of the request that triggers the action, that will serve as variable values that you can supply to your action's code. These parameters will serve as tokens in the action definition and will be replaced with the actual values when the code executes.
