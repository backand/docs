# Read Data
# Deep vs. Lazy Load
We will discuss two options to read complex object. Deep and Lazy Load. But first, what is a complex object? A complex object is an object with relations to other object. For example, in the default model that you get when you start a new Backand app there are two objects: users and items. There is a one-to-many relation between users and items which means that a specific user may have many items were each of those items relate into one specific user. In this example both users and items are complex objects.
