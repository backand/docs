You can create and call your own custom queries in your application. You can use parameters as tokens that will be replaced with the actual parameter values, similar to how [custom actions](customactions.md) work. You can create your own filters, sorting, and paging, as well as use aggregation to summarize information.

Click [NOSQL Query Language](nosql_query_language.md) for instruction on how to build queries with noSQL language or 
use common MySQL syntax.
