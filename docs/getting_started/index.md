Backand's REST API allows you to fully access and manipulate the backend data for your system, giving you full access to the underlying database and related functionality from any program that can send an HTTP request. While we start by wrapping your database in a true RESTful API Interface, we also give you a lot of extras that you can build into your app:

* You can define and execute custom queries that are triggered by a call to a URL
* You can define and execute custom actions that execute whenever you hit a specific endpoint. These can be as simple as sending an email, or as complex as a custom server-side javascript function.
* You can manage user security and access to your application automatically through Backand's security and authorization system
* You can test every single endpoint in your system using Backand's API Playground
* You can get immediate and up-to-date looks at your database's underlying tables and stored data, and even perform real-time manipulations of that data
* You can create, retrieve, update, and delete every object in your system through a simple web call, and return as much - or as little - detail as you need

Let's take a quick look at each available action in the Backand dashboard, and get started with focusing on the front-end of your application!
