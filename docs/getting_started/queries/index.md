Queries are custom database queries, written in SQL, that you can later hit through a specific endpoint (see Quick Reference for details on the URL format).

## Create a query

You can add a new query by clicking on "+New Query" in the menu bar. This allows you to name the query, provide any parameters necessary, and then write the query. It also allows you to set a specific security template for the query to use as it executes, and allows you to override the security template settings when running the query.

## Update an existing Query

To update an existing query, select the query from the navigation menu and press the "Edit" button.

## Test a query

You can test both new and existing queries using the Test query parameters panel on the right hand side of the page. This executes the query, returning both the data of the query and the URL used to execute the query.
