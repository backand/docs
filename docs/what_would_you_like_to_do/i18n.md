# Multi language support

Supporting multiple languages often requires supporting multibyte charafcter sets. In order to allow for wider international character sets, you will need to run the folloing MySQL command against your database:

ALTER TABLE database.table MODIFY COLUMN col VARCHAR(255)
    CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
