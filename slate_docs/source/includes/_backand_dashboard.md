# Backand Dashboard

Backand's REST API allows you to fully access and manipulate the backend data for your system, giving you full access to the underlying database and related functionality from any program that can send an HTTP request. While we start by wrapping your database in a true RESTful API Interface, we also give you a lot of extras that you can use to replace the server in your app:

* You can define and execute custom queries that are triggered by a call to a URL
* You can define and execute custom actions that execute whenever you hit a specific endpoint. These can be as simple as sending an email, or as complex as a custom server-side javascript function.
* You can manage user security and access to your application automatically through Backand's security and authorization system
* You can test every single endpoint in your system using Backand's API Playground
* You can get immediate and up-to-date looks at your database's underlying tables and stored data, and even perform real-time manipulations of that data
* You can create, retrieve, update, and delete every object in your system through a simple web call, and return as much - or as little - detail as you need

Let's take a quick look at each available action in the Backand dashboard, and get started with focusing on the front-end of your application!

## Docs & API
The Docs & API tab contains links to kickstart tutorials, tutorials on converting existing applications to use Backand, and other useful documentation. let's take a look at each menu category below.
### Examples
This links to our [examples page](https://www.backand.com/apps/), which has useful sample applications for many different platforms. These sample applications work to show how best to integrate Backand with an application for each mentioned platform, and can be a good starting point for integrating Backand with an existing (or brand new) application.

### Kickstart Tutorials
Our kickstart tutorials provide a list of kickstart apps that you can use to build an app for the platform specified. These kickstart apps ship with Backand already built-in and integrated, and provide you with tools to explore the SDK's functionality. They all work with the default data model, so getting the kickstart app wired up to a new Backand application is a simple matter of changing the appropriate keys in each example.

<aside class='notice'>
We provide a platform selector, which allows you to only view the kickstarts, existing apps, and code samples throughout the dashboard that are relevant to your needs. Simply choose a different platform, and the dashboard will present all examples in the relevant version of JavaScript that matches your selection.
</aside>

### Existing App Tutorials
Our existing app tutorials provide a list of tutorials on connecting Backand into your existing application, with a number of different frameworks supported. These focus on including the Backand SDK, connecting to your app, and working with the data model. If you'd like to see another platform included, please [contact us](https://www.backand.com/contact/)!

### REST API Playground
## Objects
The "Objects" section of the dashboard allows you to modify the specific objects in your application's database. A menu entry is created for each table in your database, and allows you to configure your application at the object level. For each object in your system, you are given access to the following areas to modify and work with.

### Model
> This sample model JSON creates two objects - Items and Users

```json
[
  {
    "name": "items",
    "fields": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "user": {
        "object": "users"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "users",
    "fields": {
      "email": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "firstName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "lastName": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "items": {
        "collection": "items",
        "via": "user"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

The Model parent tab allows you to modify your database's model structure, adding new objects and establishing the relationship between them. This can be done using either our GUI model editor, or the JSON schema editor. We also provide a tab demonstrating how to make - and sync - changes to your database using an external database tool (like MySQL Workbench). Below is a brief overview of how to use this interface.

<aside class="notice">
In addition to the fields supplied by the user, Backand defines an 'id' field, of type integer, which will be used as a primary key for the table.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">Backand offers support for automated population of created and updated timestamps. Simply add the `createdAt` or `updatedAt` fields to your model, and if they are present Backand will automatically populate them with the timestamp of the most recent POST or PUT request to that object.</aside>

#### Model Diagram
The Model Diagram tab provides a GUI editor for working with your app's database schema. It works with the model JSON in the background to orchestrate changes to your database. Using the GUI you can easily add new objects, update existing objects, create relations between objects, and all other related database modification tasks.

#### Model JSON
The Model JSON tab provides a straightforward method of editing your database schema using well-formed JSON. You're given a pane to perform your edits, and a comparison pane so that you can easily see what has changed from the current schema. Once your changes are finalized, click "Validate & Update" to finalize your changes.

#### Database (pending)
This tab describes how to make the changes you desire in your model directly in the database. Once you've made your changes via whichever RDBMS tool you prefer, you can click the "Sync your database" button to pull the changes into Backand, updating your schema and object list.

### Object List
For each object in your schema, you are provided a dedicated management area for that object. These are accessed via a list beneath the "New object" entry.

Each object has a set of tabs provided that allow you to modify either the object's data, or the object itself. These tabs are Data, Actions, Security, Settings, and REST API

<aside class="notice">You can also use the "New object" to quickly create a new object to add to your system.</aside>
#### Data tab
The data tab provides you with a quick method by which you can add new records, update existing records, or remove records from your database. For every action you take in this pane, we provide the code needed to reproduce the action using the SDK - simply select the appropriate language/JavaScript framework for your project, and copy the code into your application.

We also give you access to the Filter Data functionality, which can be used to quickly construct request filters that can be applied to GET requests. Simply click on the "Filter Data" link to expose a UI for constructing your filter, and the resulting parameter code will appear in the "Request Code" textbox on the right side of the screen.

#### Actions tab
The Actions tab allows you to work with custom actions in your object. Custom actions allow you to perform automated tasks in your Backand application. You can create actions that execute at any point during the database transaction context for an object, or create actions that execute whenever a specific URL is hit. See [our documentation on custom actions](#custom-actions) for more information.

#### Security tab
The security tab allows you to create custom filters that apply restrictions to loading data associated with the user session. You can also use this tab to override your app's global security configuration, allowing custom access to your object based on user role, and also restrict access to specific fields in the object as necessary.

#### Settings tab
The Settings tab allows you to modify properties of your object directly, and work with each field in the object. At the object level, you're given the capability to enable change tracking, or to set a descriptive column. Change tracking keeps a record of all changes to an object as they occur, storing these results in App Dashboard -> Log -> Data History. This can result in performance impacts, so you should use this feature sparingly. A descriptive column represents the object when it is retrieves as a part of a list, providing the user with an easy-to-understand indicator for the current object record they are manipulating.

The field properties provide you with the capability to make a field searchable (available via the "Search" filter when making API calls), mark a field as "required", or provide a default value for a field. These options are presented for each field in your object, but depending on usage may not be modifiable. If a field represents a link to another object in your system, you are provided with a hyperlink in the settings section that takes you directly to that related object's datagrid view.

#### REST API tab
The REST API tab offers you the capability to test all of the standard database actions with a custom Swagger interface. Once you execute the call, the request that was made - and the response received - are both provided, allowing you to quickly adopt the action into your app.

## Queries
The queries tab provides you with the capability to generate custom queries in your system. Simply click "New Query" to start building out a custom query. When building a new query you can provide a name, input parameters, and the query body using either NoSQL or SQL syntax. You can also set the security template of the query, restricting the query access based on the user's role. On the right side of this screen, you can also perform a quick test of your query by hitting either "Test Query" or "Save & Test". The test process will present the query's URL endpoint, the SDK code needed to call the query, and a sample response.

### Query List
As you create queries, you're provided with a list of the queries present in your system. Simply click on the name of a query to begin editing or testing the query's contents.

### Create a query
You can add a new query by clicking on "+New Query" in the menu bar. This allows you to name the query, provide any parameters necessary, and then write the query. It also allows you to set a specific security template for the query to use as it executes, and allows you to override the security template settings when running the query.

### Update an existing query
To update an existing query, select the query from the navigation menu and press the "Edit" button.

### Test a query
You can test both new and existing queries using the Test query parameters panel on the right hand side of the page. This executes the query, returning both the data of the query and the URL used to execute the query.

## Background Jobs
Background jobs (also known as cron jobs) allow you to run an action, query, or external URL request on a schedule that you define. Simply set the time and frequency, and the desired task will be executed automatically by Backand's servers. With this mechanism, you can run periodic queries for things like reports, recurring actions to control your application's behavior, or regularly post to external services.

### Create a job
To create a new Background job, click on "+ New Job" in the "Background jobs" section of the navigation bar. Simply add a name, a description, a start time or frequency, and set the type of job (Action, Query, External URL) to execute.

#### Advanced Options
In the advanced options, you can configure the job to operate via a POST or GET request. The GET request allows you to configure the query string used in the request, as well as modify the headers sent - allowing you to send additional parameters to the job when it executes. For POST requests, you can modify both the headers and the query string, but you are also given the Request Data field which you can use to send additional parameter formats, such as long text.

This can be very useful in distinguishing between two jobs that run the same action. For each job, you can send a "type" parameter to indicate the specific job being run. You can accomplish this by setting the "Query String" field to the appropriate value: `parameters={type:1}` for job 1, and `parameters={type:2}` for job 2.

### Update an existing job
You can update existing job by selecting the background job from the navigation menu and pressing the "Edit" button. This allows you to change all aspects of the job.

### Test a job
You can test both new and existing jobs using the Test buttons on the right hand side of the page. These buttons execute the job on Backand's servers, displaying the request sent and the response received. In addition to simple verification, testing can be used to verify that advanced parameters function properly, and that the job responds as expected.

### Run background job using REST API
```shell
  curl https://api.backand.com/1/jobs/run/{id}
```

```javascript
   var response = $http({
       method: "GET",
       url: CONSTS.apiUrl + "/1/jobs/run/" + cronId
   });
```

Background Jobs are useful for long running tasks such as integrating with external sites (where the response time could be slow), or sending out batched push notifications. If you commonly encounter timeout errors while running on-demand actions, then you should consider using a Background Job.

All messages and errors are logged into the console. These messages are available in the dashboard under Log --> Console.


### Test background job
```bash
curl https://api.backand.com/1/jobs/run/{id}/test
```

In order to test the job and get a response immediately (either valid results or an error message), use the following REST endpoint.

<aside class="notice">this call runs synchronously, so it may take a long time to finish</aside>

## Analytics
The Analytics section provides several reports exploring the various facets of you app's performance. You are able to provide a date range to examine, using preconfigured date ranges our your own custom range. You can use these to gain insight on user activity within your app, as well as on the resources being used by your application.

### Reports
Backand provides the following reports for your app:

* Activity-based reports
  * Devices by Country
  * Daily Active Devices
  * Weekly Active Devices
  * Montly Active Devices
  * Registered Users by Country
  * Daily Active Registered Users
  * Weekly Active Registered Users
  * Monthly Active Registered Users
  * Top Active Registered Users
* Performance-based reports
  * Requests per Objects
  * Slow Requests
* Usage-based reports
  * Backand Compute
  * Cache Memory
  * Requests per Second
  * Data Hosting

## Security & Auth
The Security & Auth section allows you to modify the security settings for your application, setting both application-level and user-level security policies.

### Security configuration
The Security Configuration section allows you to set application-wide settings for access to your project.

#### Anonymous Access

When enabled, this allows any user with a link to access your application. You can set a role for anonymous users, and obtain an anonymous access token to use in your application's code.

#### Public App
The Public App settings determines whether users can sign up for your app, or if they must be invited. You can also assign a role to each invited user.

<aside class="warning">Email verification is disabled by default, so verifying users requires an extra setting change for your application.</aside>

#### Custom pages
These custom pages are pages within your application code that are used for user registration and login. The Custom Registration Page URL is supplied in the invitation email sent to new users. The Custom Verified Email Page URL is sent to the user after they have verified their email address. Note that these are pages on your own servers, and not a part of Backand. These pages are only sent when Sign-up Email Verification is enabled.

#### Sign-up Email Verification
This enables or disables automated user email verification. When enabled, users are sent a verification email by Backand which they must use to verify their account. When disabled, this action is not performed and users are immediately able to use their account.

### Social & Keys
The Social & Keys page consists of two parts - the tokens, and the social media configurations. These settings are used in your app to enable integration with social media providers, allowing your users to sign into your app using their social media accounts.

#### Master Token

The master Token is a token that you can use to access your Backand app without a username or password.
<aside class="warning">Use this token carefully, as it gives the user full access to your application.. This token mast be sent with the user's GUID key. The master key is used with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" target="\_blank">basic authentication</a>, simply enter the master key as the username, and the user's GUID key as the password.</aside>

#### API Signup Token
The API Signup Token is used whenever you contact the Backand API to register a new user with your application.

#### Social Configuration

### Registered Users
The registered users page lists all users currently registered for your app. You can add new user, edit existing user details, delete a user, or invite a new user to your application via email. You can also manually enter - and edit - user passwords from this interface.

### Team
The Team section allows you to add new administrative users to your application. Admin users have full access to the application dashboard, and your application's configuration. You can perform all of the same actions available on the Users page on the Team page as well.

### Security Actions
The actions on this page, much like those on the other pages of the application, allow you to define custom actions to occur at each point in the transactional CRUD conversation against an object, or when called by accessing a specific URL. These actions, though, are tied specifically to the internal Backand Users object, which manages your application''s security. All of the standard custom action options are available for use in this section, and you can easily create new actions, edit existing actions, and test the actions you have created.

There are several actions provided by default by Backand. The User Invitation Email and Admin Invitation Email actions allow you to modify the emails sent to a user when they are invited to the application. The User Approval action allows you to modify the approval email received by the user after email verification. The New User Verification action allows you to modify the generic verification email sent when sign-up verification is enabled. Finally, the Request Reset Password action allows you to modify the email sent when a user requests a password reset token.

### Security Templates
Security templates allow you to create a template that is used to set permissions on objects. You can create new templates, update existing templates, and rename security templates as you see fit. Each of the checkboxes corresponds to the REST API action indicated by the column header. When you check "Create" for a user role, for example, and then assign that security template to an object, all users with the specified role will be granted "Create" access to the object.
